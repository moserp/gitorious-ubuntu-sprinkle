Sprinkle script to install gitorious onto an Ubuntu Server.
Tested on Ubuntu 10.10.

To use, first edit deploy.rb to set your destination server.
Make sure your user has sudo access.

Then:

gem install bundler sprinkle
bundle install
bundle exec sprinkle -s gitorious.rb


Once the sprinkle script has run, you need to create an admin user:
As the git user, run: 
env RAILS_ENV=production ruby script/create_admin
